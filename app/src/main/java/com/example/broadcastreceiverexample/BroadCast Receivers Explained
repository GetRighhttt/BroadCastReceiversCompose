Broadcast and BroadCast Receivers

Google Developers state that android apps can send or receive BROADCAST messages from the Android
system and other Android apps similar to a pub-sub design pattern. These broadcast are sent when
an event occurs, like a system boots up, airplane mode is turned off, etc. Apps can also send custom
broadcast that act in the same way. An example of this would be when something has finished
downloading, notifications, etc.

BROADCAST RECEIVERS are when apps register to receive these said broadcast by way of either
declaring those receivers in the manifest file of the application, or registering receivers by way
of context. These receivers get triggered when said broadcast is received, and we can use this
event to trigger other events to happen, or do some action in our application as a result.
